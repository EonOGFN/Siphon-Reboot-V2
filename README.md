### This source is [Project Reboot 3.0](https://github.com/Milxnor/Project-Reboot-3.0) with a twist. 
- **Note:** We added the Siphon Animation with materials after a kill. No, this isn't MagmaDev's code.

## Credits

## How To
- **Enable/Disable Animation**: To enable or disable the animation, go to `globals.h`, find `Siphon`, and change it from `true` to `false`.
- **Change Material Amount**: To change the amount of materials you receive, go to `globals.h` and find `SiphonMaterials`. Note that the number you set is the amount you get per material. For example, if the number is 50 (default), you will receive 50 wood, 50 stone, and 50 metal, totaling 150 materials.
